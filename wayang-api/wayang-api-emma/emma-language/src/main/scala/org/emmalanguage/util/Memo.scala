/**
 * Memoizing different types of functions.
 *
 * Calling a memoized function with a set of arguments for the first time will save the result in a
 * cache - a [[mutable.Map]], possibly user-provided. Calling it with the same set of arguments
 * subsequently will not perform the computation, but retrieve the cached value instead.
 *
 * This is useful for computations that are expensive and are performed many times with the same
 * arguments.
 *
 * However, functions need to be referentially transparent (i.e. have no side effects) to preserve
 * correctness.
