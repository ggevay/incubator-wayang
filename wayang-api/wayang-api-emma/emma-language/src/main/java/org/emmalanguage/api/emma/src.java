/**
 * A holder for the name of the field in the enclosing object, where a serialized code of an
 * annotated method can be found.
 * <p>
 * For example
 * <p>
 * {@code
 * object foo {
 *   // ...
 *   {@literal @}src("applyQ$01")
 *   def apply(...) = { ... }
 * }
 * }
 * <p>
 * Implies that `foo` contains a field named `applyQ$01` which returns the code of `apply` as
 * a string.

 * Instances of this annotation are placed by the `emma.lib` macro, please do not use this
