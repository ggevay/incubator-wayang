     * as driver-only or high (that is, it can be called from a higher-order context). (Some ValDefs have been
     * duplicated for this.)

     * in the driver.
     *
     * Algorithm:
     * 1. Collect symbols of all function ValDefs. (funs)
     * 2. Build a graph of funs referencing funs. (funGraph)
     * 3. Collect funs that are given as arguments to combinators. (topLevRefs)
     * 4. Collect funs referenced from top-level. (combRefs)
     * 5. Do graph traversals on funGraph from combRefs and topLevRefs to get all high and
     *    driver-only funs, respectively. (highFuns0, driverFuns)
     * 6. The intersection of highFuns0 and driverFuns are the ambiguous ones. Create new ValDefs
     *    for these, and modify refs to them in high code to the newly created vals.
