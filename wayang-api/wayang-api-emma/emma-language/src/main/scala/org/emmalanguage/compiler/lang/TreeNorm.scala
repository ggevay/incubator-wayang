  /**
   *  Starting at the return value of a let-block, resorts val definitions within the tree in a depth-first manner.
   *
   *  The order of ValDefs will be a post-order traversal of the DAG that has ValDefs as its nodes, and there is a
   *  directed edge from u to v if the RHS of u's ValDef refers to v's ValDef.
   *  Note that the order of the recursive calls from a single node is determined by the order in which the collect
   *  call on the RHS returns the ValRefs. For this reason, this has to be a bottom-up transform, so that if there is a
   *  let-block in the RHS of a ValDef then it should have already been normalized.
   *
   *  In other words, TreeNorm will transform "equivalent" programs into identical trees, where "programA equivalent
   *  programB" means that programA can be transformed into programB by reordering ValDefs.
   *
   *  e.g.:
   *  {{{
   *    val $x4 = d.id
   *    val $x3 = c.id
   *    val $x2 = b.id
   *    val $x1 = a.id
   *    val $t1 = (a.id, b.id)
   *    val $t2 = (c.id, d.id)
   *    val $== = (t1 == t2)
   *  }}}
   *
   *  ==Resort Into==
   *  {{{

   *    val $t1 = (a.id, b.id)
   *    val $x3 = c.id
   *    val $x4 = d.id
   *    val $t2 = (c.id, d.id)
